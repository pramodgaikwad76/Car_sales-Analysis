The Car Dekho Sales Analysis project uses MySQL to analyze car sales data from the car_dekho dataset. It offers insights into car availability by year and fuel type, aiding decision-making for dealerships and sales managers. Key features include year-wise and fuel-wise counts, threshold analysis, and comprehensive inventory reports.
Features:

Data Retrieval:

Fetch complete records from the car_dekho table.
Retrieve total car counts across all records.
Yearly Analysis:

Calculate the number of cars available for specific years (e.g., 2023).
Determine the number of cars available in selected years (2020, 2021, 2022).
Group By Queries:

Group car counts by year for specified periods.
Group car counts by fuel type and year.
Fuel Type Analysis:

Count diesel and petrol cars for specific years.
